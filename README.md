BeerJS PHL
=========

BeerJS PHL is a gathering group for Philadelphians (and visitors!) to get together for activities
revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript!  We organize events at
[meetup.com/Philadelphia-JavaScript-Developers](http://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-JavaScript-Developers/).

Don't drink beer? Enjoy a good cocktail? Don't drink at all?  Everyone is welcome and encouraged to
come.

This gathering has no agenda.  There are no set topics.  Come out talk, JS and get to know your
fellow Javascripters!

We will be meeting once a month in bars around center city Philadelphia.  If you have a suggestion
for a meeting location feel free to make a PR on this repo or speak with JB.  We are also open to
meeting in the burbs from time to time!
